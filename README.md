✨ Hand Gesture Laptop Shutdown ✨
This project of mine uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to recognize a closed fist gesture and then automatically shuts down the laptop.

🚀 Features
🔹 Detects a closed fist using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
🔹 Triggers an automatic shutdown using PyAutoGUI.
🔹 Works in real-time using an external webcam or in my case the preinstalled camera in our laptops..

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV (for image processing)
MediaPipe (for hand tracking)
PyAutoGUI (for system automation)
